# Day 3 Assignment
This task helps you become familiar with Cascading StyleSheets by building a simple web page for a travel agency.

## Due
This assignment does not need to be handed in. Your instructor will review it the next morning so you can ask questions and get assistance with any problems you might encounter. You will build onto this assignment in the remaining assignments of this course. If you want feedback on your code you can ask your instructor to check it and give advice. You will be required to hand in the cumulative code after day 6 for marking. Your instructor will set the due date for you.

## Directions
In this exercise you will enhance the travel agency web pages to use Cascading StyleSheets to add styles to various HTML tags.
- Using a media query, try changing your from one-column (mobile) to two-column (tablet+). Don't forget to set a `max-width` to keep your form usable on large screens.
- Download and link to an external stylesheet page that will reset your styles to defaults (hint: normalize is a popular option)
- Create an external stylesheet file and link it into your pages to provide custom style settings.
- Ensure that the input tags in your form all have a light background colour to make them more noticeable.
- In the register page, set up a form that has fields for entering and submitting customer data. Since you donâ€™t have a server-side script to process the data, try using a  free static form service.
- Layout a contact form using flexbox or css grid. (hint: there are many grid examples available on [Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com/))

## Feedback:
Your instructor will review this exercise with you the next day.

If you have any questions or wish to get some feedback on your work before the hand-in date, ask your instructor to review it with you after class.
