# Day 2 Assignment
This task helps you become familiar with advanced features of HTML by enhancing the travel agency website.

## Due
This assignment does not need to be handed in. Your instructor will review it the next morning so you can ask questions and get assistance with any problems you might encounter. You will build onto this assignment in the remaining assignments of this course. If you want feedback on your code you can ask your instructor to check it and give advice. You will be required to hand in the cumulative code after day 6 for marking. Your instructor will set the due date for you.

## Directions
In this exercise you will build the first part of a web site for a travel agency. This page will use basic HTML tags, and will be enhanced each day to add more complex features as you learn them. It will be the main deliverable that you will hand in for marking at the end of the course.
- In the index.html page, use HTML5 sematic elements to format the page. 
- Each page should have the same global navigation. Use `nav` and `ul` to link each page to each other.
- Define style settings that will set the font type, size, and color of the text in your tags. Experiment with different settings for different tag types.
- On the main page, create a hero section. Use CSS to set a background image for the page (ensure that the image is light/dark enough to use as a background image).

## Feedback:
Your instructor will review this exercise with you the next day.

If you have any questions or wish to get some feedback on your work before the hand-in date, ask your instructor to review it with you after class.
