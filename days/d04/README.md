## Activity: Design and Usability
- Break into groups of three or four and visit a few different Travel Agency websites.
- What problem are they trying to solve overall?
- How do they approach solving that problem?
- Look at different parts of the site and look at
what works well and what doesn't work well.
    - What conventions do you see?
    - Are there any violations in convention?
    - Are they effectively creating visual hierarchy? Why/why not?

  - mobile first -> min-width
  - desktop first -> max-width
- cascade: source order considerations
  - media queries should go at the bottom of your style sheet. They override the base styles above the query.
- live code: background-color and media queries
