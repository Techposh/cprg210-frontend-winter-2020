# Day 1 Assignment
This task helps you become familiar with the fundamentals of HTML by building a simple web site for a travel agency.

## Due
This assignment does not need to be handed in. Your instructor will review it the next morning so you can ask questions and get assistance with any problems you might encounter. You will build onto this assignment in the remaining assignments of this course. If you want feedback on your code you can ask your instructor to check it and give advice. You will be required to hand in the cumulative code after day 6 for marking. Your instructor will set the due date for you.

## Directions
In this exercise you will build the first part of a web site for a travel agency. This page will use basic HTML tags, and will be enhanced each day to add more complex features as you learn them. It will be the main deliverable that you will hand in for marking at the end of the course.

- Create 3 pages named “index.html”, “register.html”, and “contact.html”.
- In the index.html page, display an image at the top of the page that will be your travel agency logo. Next, display an “h1” heading with the text “Welcome to Travel Experts” inside it. As a challenge, see if you can find a way to make both of these display on the same line.
- On the next line, display some travel pictures (there are some in the media folder if you don’t have time to find any free images online).
- On the next line, display two images that are links to the “contact.html” and “register.html” pages (wrap them inside an anchor tag). There are two images in the media folder that would work for this.
- In the contact.html page, use lists and paragraph tags to display the contact information for the agency and the individual agents.
- In the register page, just have a heading that indicates that the page is under construction. Try to center this heading horizontally *and vertically* in the vieport. There are many ways to do this.
- At the bottom of the index.html page display a copyright message with a copyright symbol (hint: search for html entities and/or icon fonts).
- Set up borders on some of your tags.
- Customize, experiment, and build extra features if you have time. Use semantic tags when possible.

## Feedback:
Your instructor will review this exercise with you the next day.

If you have any questions or wish to get some feedback on your work before the hand-in date, ask your instructor to review it with you after class.
