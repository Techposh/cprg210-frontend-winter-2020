## Command Line Interface: Navigating the file system
[CLI (command line interface) Cheat Sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/command-line-cheat-sheet/)

### The 3 commands you will use 80% of the time
- `pwd`: displays your 'present working directory'. This will usually default to your home folder when you first open your terminal.
- `ls`: lists the contents of your current directory. The `-l` flag lists extra information and `-a` lists hidden files. `-la` will list extra information and also all hidden files.
- `cd`: changes your directory based on the path you provide after the command (separated by a space). Examples:
  - `$ cd Documents/fast-track`
  - `$ cd /h/sait/fast-track`
  - `$ cd ../..`

Quality of life cli tips
- tab: auto-completes file names and directories
- up arrow: browse through command history
